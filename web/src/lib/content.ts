    "Data storage competes unfairly with payments, making Bitcoin transactions unnecessarily costly. This encourages reliance on third-party payment processors, making Bitcoin payments easier to censor.",

    question: "Why is this proposal temporary?",
    answer:
      "The one-year deployment allows the community to evaluate the impact while developers work on a longer-term solution. Some restrictions would severely constrain future upgrades if permanent, but are acceptable for a limited time to address the immediate crisis.",
    category: "general",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any tradeoffs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Limiting Taproot control blocks could complicate advanced smart contracts like BitVM. Upgrade hooks are temporarily unavailable for other softforks. Some wallet software using OP_IF in Tapleaves may need updates. However, these are acceptable short-term tradeoffs for the immediate benefits.",
    category: "tradeoffs",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there any risk of funds being frozen or lost?",
    answer:
      "In theory, yes, but this proposal goes to great pains to avoid affecting any known use cases. Funds are completely unaffected if they don't use Taproot, use Taproot in standard ways, or can be spent via keypath or other expected Tapleaves. Additionally, UTXOs created before activation are permanently exempt from the new rules — they can be spent at any time without restriction. A separate two-week grace period between lock-in and activation also provides general preparation time.",
    category: "safety",
  },
  {
    question: "Won't spammers just spread their data over multiple fields?",
    answer:
      "While it's impossible to fully prevent steganography, limiting data sizes ensures abuses are non-contiguous and obfuscated. Requiring users to divide files into chunks of 256 bytes raises the cost in fees and effort, sending a clear message that data storage is unwelcome.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Why not let the fee market manage data storage?",
    answer:
      "The fee for data storage goes only to the miner, but all node operators must store the data forever without compensation. This creates an unfair burden where miners accept one-time fees while nodes provide perpetual storage for free.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Why limit scriptPubKeys to 34 bytes?",
    answer:
      "scriptPubKeys must be stored indefinitely in quick-access memory by all nodes. Modern usage is all 34 bytes or smaller, as actual spending conditions are in the witness. Large scriptPubKeys enable data abuse and malicious 'poison blocks' that take a long time to validate.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this break multisig?",
    answer:
      "No. Vanilla multisig (BIP-48, BIP-174, BIP-129) is completely unaffected. Taproot multisig using MuSig/Schnorr signature aggregation is also unaffected. The only area with any potential impact is advanced Taproot Miniscript that uses OP_IF inside tapleaves — and the fix is straightforward: split OP_IF branches into separate tapleaves, which is already best practice for Taproot script design.",
    category: "safety",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a slippery slope toward banning use cases?",
    answer:
      "No. These rules enshrine long-standing principles of Bitcoin. This softfork doesn't restrict monetary activity—only non-monetary data storage. The temporary nature reinforces this is a targeted intervention, not a new direction.",
    category: "general",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this solve spam completely?",
    answer:
      "No. Spam is best fought with policy/filters, not consensus. This softfork minimizes the impact of malicious miners and closes the worst-case risks, while sending a clear message that data storage is not a supported use case.",
    category: "general",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this affect the UTXO set?",
    answer:
      'No. BIP-110 only limits the size of new outputs going forward — it doesn\'t touch, invalidate, or prune any existing UTXOs. You may be thinking of "The Cat," a separate proposal that would blacklist specific non-monetary UTXOs (like Ordinals and Stamps) and make them permanently unspendable so nodes can prune them. BIP-110 takes a completely different approach: instead of retroactively invalidating existing outputs, it simply limits the size of new ones to discourage future abuse.',
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this affect the Lightning Network?",
    answer:
      "No. Standard Lightning channels use P2WSH (witness v0), and BIP-110's OP_IF restriction only applies to Tapscripts — so they're completely unaffected. Newer Taproot-based channels split conditional paths into separate tapleaves instead of using OP_IF, so they're also compatible. Both P2WSH and P2TR outputs are exactly 34 bytes, within the limit.",
    category: "safety",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is OP_IF restricted in Tapscripts?",
    answer:
      "Taproot was designed so that each conditional branch lives in its own tapleaf. This is the entire point of MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Trees). Using OP_IF inside a tapleaf is redundant: it reveals unused branches on-chain, defeating Taproot's privacy benefits. In some cases OP_IF can save a few bytes by avoiding merkle path overhead, but at the cost of exposing your other spending conditions to the world. Well-designed Taproot wallets already split conditions into separate tapleaves. This restriction only applies to Tapscripts, so P2WSH scripts (like standard Lightning channels) are completely unaffected.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from relay policy filters?",
    answer:
      "Relay policy (mempool filtering) only affects transaction propagation — miners can still include anything they want in blocks. BIP-110 enforces limits at the consensus level, meaning blocks containing oversized data are invalid regardless of who mines them. Policy is a suggestion; consensus is a rule.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this optional for miners?",
    answer:
      "During the signaling phase, miners choose whether to signal support. If 55% signal in a retarget period, the softfork locks in early. If not, mandatory signaling kicks in before the deadline — blocks that don't signal are rejected, guaranteeing lock-in. Once activated, the new rules are enforced at the consensus level: any block that violates them is rejected by all enforcing nodes, regardless of the miner's preference.",
    category: "general",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when the deployment expires?",
    answer:
      "After approximately one year (52,416 blocks), all restrictions automatically lift and Bitcoin returns to its pre-activation rules. No action is needed from users or node operators. If the community wants to continue or refine the protections, a new proposal would need to go through the activation process again.",
