    "Starting with the 'inscription' hack in 2022, a trend emerged around embedding arbitrary data into Bitcoin transactions. This creates unnecessary burdens on node operators and diverts development focus from Bitcoin's fundamental purpose: being sound, permissionless, borderless money.",
    "Data storage competes unfairly with payments, making Bitcoin transactions unnecessarily costly. This encourages reliance on third-party payment processors, making Bitcoin payments easier to censor.",
    "By limiting data storage, this proposal liberates developers from endless scope creep, enabling them to focus on what's really important: Bitcoin's success as money.",

  {
    question: "Why is this proposal temporary?",
    answer:
      "The one-year deployment allows the community to evaluate the impact while developers work on a longer-term solution. Some restrictions would severely constrain future upgrades if permanent, but are acceptable for a limited time to address the immediate crisis.",
    category: "general",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any tradeoffs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Limiting Taproot control blocks could complicate advanced smart contracts like BitVM. Upgrade hooks are temporarily unavailable for other softforks. Some wallet software using OP_IF in Tapleaves may need updates. However, these are acceptable short-term tradeoffs for the immediate benefits.",
    category: "tradeoffs",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there any risk of funds being frozen or lost?",
    answer:
      "In theory, yes, but this proposal goes to great pains to avoid affecting any known use cases. Funds are completely unaffected if they don't use Taproot, use Taproot in standard ways, or can be spent via keypath or other expected Tapleaves. A two-week grace period between lock-in and activation gives users time to migrate any affected funds.",
    category: "safety",
  },
  {
    question: "Won't spammers just spread their data over multiple fields?",
    answer:
      "While it's impossible to fully prevent steganography, limiting data sizes ensures abuses are non-contiguous and obfuscated. Requiring users to divide files into chunks of 256 bytes raises the cost in fees and effort, sending a clear message that data storage is unwelcome.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Why not let the fee market manage data storage?",
    answer:
      "The fee for data storage goes only to the miner, but all node operators must store the data forever without compensation. This creates an unfair burden where miners accept one-time fees while nodes provide perpetual storage for free.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Why limit scriptPubKeys to 34 bytes?",
    answer:
      "scriptPubKeys must be stored indefinitely in quick-access memory by all nodes. Modern usage is all 34 bytes or smaller, as actual spending conditions are in the witness. Large scriptPubKeys enable data abuse and malicious 'poison blocks' that take a long time to validate.",
    category: "technical",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a slippery slope toward banning use cases?",
    answer:
      "No. These rules enshrine long-standing principles of Bitcoin. This softfork doesn't restrict monetary activity—only non-monetary data storage. The temporary nature reinforces this is a targeted intervention, not a new direction.",
    category: "general",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this solve spam completely?",
    answer:
      "No. Spam is best fought with policy/filters, not consensus. This softfork minimizes the impact of malicious miners and closes the worst-case risks, while sending a clear message that data storage is not a supported use case.",
